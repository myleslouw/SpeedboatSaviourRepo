  sentences:
  - "Darling, the fallen trees across the river have been blocking the water stream!
    New fish haven\u2019t been able to come this way, and fishing is our bread and
    butter!"
  - "I know mom, I just don\u2019t know what to do. The tree is way too big for just
    two people to move!"
  - "I spoke to Rodger, he said he can get his team to move the tree, but he can\u2019t
    do it for free."
  - "We can\u2019t afford to pay people, mom. Sales at the market have dropped."
  - Rodger and I made a deal, we clean the river and in return they will remove the
    tree.
  - "Great! I\u2019ll take the boat and start cleaning, you should stay home, I don\u2019t
    want you to strain your hip any more than you already have."
  - "Thank you, my child. Don\u2019t forget, you can use W A S D to move around and
    use the mouse to rotate the camera. Simply move into an item to pick it up! Find
    and speak to Rodger as soon as you are done."
