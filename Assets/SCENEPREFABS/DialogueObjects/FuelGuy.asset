  - "Pst. Hey kid. Yeah you\u2026 Want some fuel?"
  - "What\u2026"
  - "Fuel\u2026 For your boat."
  - "Pete didn\u2019t mention anything about fuel."
  - "Well, if you need any, I\u2019m your guy!"
  - But my boat has been running fine without any.
  - "Well, that is because your tiny boat doesn\u2019t have much power. However,
    when you need to upgrade to a stronger, faster, and more powerful boat, you will
    be back!"
  - So, I just come to you when I need a fuel refill?
  - Yup! When your fuel gage is running low, just pop on over, easy as that!
