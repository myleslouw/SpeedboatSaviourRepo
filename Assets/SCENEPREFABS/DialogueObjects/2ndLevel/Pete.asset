  sentences:
  - "Hi, you must be Mary\u2019s kid! She\u2019s told me a lot about you. My name\u2019s
    Pete. I\u2019ll guide you through all things boat-related!"
  - Hi, nice to finally meet you, Pete. The reporter said I should come see you about
    boat upgrades.
  - "Oh, that James fella is an odd one\u2026 he just pops up everywhere. But yes,
    you\u2019ve come to the right place if you want a good deal on a new boat!"
  - How does it work exactly?
  - You will gradually accumulate coins throughout your journeys which you can save
    up to buy an upgraded boat! They are stronger, faster, bigger, more durable,
    and of course super cool-looking! These sweet rides do it all!
  - Sign me up! Let me see the options!
  - Check out the boat signs right next to me for a neat selection of upgrades.
  - "Thanks! But\u2026what do I do with all this trash? It\u2019s taking up so much
    space and it stinks!"
  - "Simple. Just head to the recycle bins across the pond and dump \u2018em in the
    correct bins."
  - Best I get to it then.
  - Wait, have you ever thought about joining the Water Babies? They could use someone
    as efficient as you.
  - Really? You think so?
  - "\u2018Course I do! Something to think about. You should know, we have barricaded
    the ponds and rivers off from each other to prevent pollution from spreading. "
  - "It clearly hasn\u2019t fixed anything but sure is prolonging the inevitable!"
  - 'How about we help each other out. You continue to clean the water for the villagers,
    and I will remove each barricade for you as soon as you finish cleaning a specific
    area. '
  - Great! Thanks!
  - No problem. Now run along!
