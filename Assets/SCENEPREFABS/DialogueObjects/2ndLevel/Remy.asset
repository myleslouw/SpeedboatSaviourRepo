  - "Look at this! All this trash polluting our water! The Water Babies can\u2019t
    let this slide."
  - Hi there, I can help you if you want.
  - "Wait, aren\u2019t you that kid who cleaned Shell Pond? You did a fantastic job!"
  - "Thanks! I\u2019m just doing my part for the village."
  - "Well, I\u2019m a representative for the Water Babies and we\u2019ve been hearing
    a lot about you! We\u2019d love it if you joined our team!"
  - Really? Me?
  - Yes! Your first job would be cleaning this disgusting pond. Can you do that?
  - "Of course! Thanks so much for the opportunity, I\u2019m in!"
  - Fantastic! The pollution has affected our water drinking and food supply. All
    the fish are dying or leaving the area.
  - "Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve done it before, and I can do it again! It will be
    spotless when I\u2019m done."
  - "Thank you! Villagers are running out of clothes and haven\u2019t been able to
    wash their laundry since the water is so dirty."
  - Soon they can!
