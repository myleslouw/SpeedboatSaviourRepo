  - Oh, how horrible this is!
  - "Hi miss, what\u2019s wrong?"
  - "Isn\u2019t it terrible what people do to the water that provides for us."
  - It is, and I hope to help fix that!
  - "You will? Won\u2019t you kindly clean this retched lake? I terribly miss seeing
    the dolphins dance about in the water. Ever since the trash began accumulating,
    the dolphins left. I would love for them to return!"
  - "Of course! I\u2019m part of the Water Babies, it\u2019s what I do!"
  - How lovely! Thank you!
