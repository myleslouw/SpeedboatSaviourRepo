  - "Woaw, kid. You need to turn around and head back. These waters aren\u2019t safe."
  - "I\u2019m here to clean the water!"
  - HAHA! You? Clean? THIS water? Not going to happen, kid, sorry.
  - "I\u2019m part of the Water Babies, it\u2019s what I do."
  - "You will need more than just one kid to clean this lake. It\u2019s called black
    lake for a reason. The pollution runs so deep, the water is charcoal black and
    thick as blood."
  - Trust me, my boat is the best of the best! I can do it.
  - "Kid, I can\u2019t force you not to go in there, but I\u2019m warning you. People
    have gone in and never returned due to the high levels of pollution."
  - "Thank you for your warning! But I can handle it. Don\u2019t worry."
